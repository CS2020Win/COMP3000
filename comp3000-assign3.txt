Collaborators:

1. There is a risk of data loss, because lines 24 and 31 of the script will delete the old image file, and the data in the confined environment will be lost, but other data in the main system will not be lost. The deletion command on line 64 has minimal impact, and only the initial script in the confined environment will be deleted

2. Run "chroot 3000fs/" command to enter the confined environment again

3. For processes on external hosts whose internal ps commands are less than true, the 65-line "unshare --root=. -f -p --mount-proc" command determines the difference

4. Installing busybox consists of creating symlinks (or hardlinks) to the busybox binary for each applet enabled in busybox, and making sure these symlinks are in the shell's command $PATH. Executed when entering a closed system

5. 8192*60000=491520000 B=468.75MB The size of the image file generated by "dd" command in line 26 determines this

6. If fill up the disk in the host system, the internal space of the confined environment is not affected and does not depend on the contents previously stored in the confined environment

7. The original name is busybox. "busybox --install" will create a lot of hardlinks, which will cause the above situation

8. Copy /bin/nano, /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.6, /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6, /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ libbc.so.6 , /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 3000fs/bin. Through the "LDD/bin/nano | awk '{print $3}'" command

9. Run the "useradd -m -d /root/3000fs/home/contain -U -R /root/3000fs contain" command.Run the 'cat /etc/passwd' command to view the result

10. Run the "mount /dev/** /mnt" command. The "mount -t devtmpfs udev /dev" command on line 60 makes this possible

11. Run the "unshare --uts chroot 3000fs/  hostname mycontainer". This change is not persistent and will be restored upon re-entry.
